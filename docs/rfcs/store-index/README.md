# perf: index the in-memory item store

## Summary

This proposal will reduce lookup cost while keeping the store implementation simple. It is intentionally scoped so the service can
ship the change independently and preserve the existing item API behavior.

## Goals

- Define observable behavior before implementation.
- Keep compatibility with existing clients.
- Make failure modes explicit and testable.

## Non-goals

This change does not introduce authentication, persistence, or a new framework.
